# LanceDB Mintlify Documentation

Home of the new LanceDB documentation on Mintlify.

## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following commands at the root of the documentation (`/docs/` in this repo, where `docs.json` is located).

```
cd docs
mint dev
```

## Generate snippets

The Python, TypeScript and Rust code snippets used in the documentation are tested prior to use in the docs. These tests are located in the `examples/` directory. Run the tests locally for each language
when building the docs locally.

MDX snippets are generated by running a separate script `scripts/mdx_snippets_gen.py`, as Mintlify cannot
scan the contents of raw code files -- it requires that the snippets are in MDX files under the
`snippets` directory.

A Makefile is provided with convience functions that run the snippet generation for each language:

```bash
# Generate snippets for each language, one by one
make py
make ts
make rs

# Or, generate them for all languages in one command
make snippets
```

The following sequence of steps are run:

1. Run tests for py, ts, rs files to verify that the code works
2. Generate MDX snippets
3. Import MDX snippets in the corresponding documentation page
4. Add the NDX snippet inside a `<CodeBlock>` component in Mintlify

This ensures that the code in the docs is in line with the latest LanceDB API

> [!NOTE]
> Do not add code snippets manually inside triple-backticks! Write the tests to the `examples` directory,
> then generate the snippets programmatically via the Makefile commands. This helps ensure that
> the documentation shows code that was actually run by a human, and by CI.
