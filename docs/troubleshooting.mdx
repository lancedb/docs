## General issues

### Slow or unexpected query results

If you have slow queries or unexpected query results, it can be helpful to
print the resolved query plan. 

LanceDB provides two powerful tools for query analysis and optimization: `explain_plan` and `analyze_plan`.

Read the full guide on [Query Optimization](/search/optimize-queries/).

### Python's multiprocessing module

Multiprocessing with `fork` is not supported. You should use `spawn` instead.

### Logging: LanceDB Cloud

To provide more information, especially for LanceDB Cloud related issues, enable
debug logging. You can set the `LANCEDB_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
export LANCEDB_LOG=debug
```

You can turn off colors and formatting in the logs by setting

```bash
export LANCEDB_LOG_STYLE=never
```
