There are two deployment models available for LanceDB Enterprise: **Managed** and **BYOC**.
Both models support AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud platforms.

## Managed deployment
This is a private deployment of LanceDB Enterprise.
All applications run in cloud accounts managed by LanceDB in the same location as your client applications.

This hands-off approach is recommended for users who do not wish to manage the infrastructure themselves.

To access your deployment, LanceDB can provision either a public or private load balancer.

## Bring-your-own-cloud (BYOC) deployment
With this deployment model, LanceDB Enterprise is installed into your own cloud account.

This approach is recommended when:
- Users' security requirements for data residency preclude them from having data leave their account
- Other applications need to access the object storage directly

To deploy, an identity will be provisioned in your account with permissions to manage the infrastructure.

## Custom deployments

LanceDB Enterprise installation is highly configurable and customizable to your needs.
If you have any other specific deployment requirements, please reach out to our support team
