**LanceDB Enterprise** is both a **private cloud or a BYOC solution** that transforms your data lake into
a high-performance vector database or lakehouse that can operate at extreme scale.

With a vector database built for [lakehouse architecture](), you can serve millions of tables and tens
of billions of rows in a single index, improve retrieval quality using hybrid search with blazing-fast
metadata filters, and reduce costs by up to 200x with object storage.

## Key benefits of LanceDB Enterprise

Below, we list the three main benefits of using LanceDB Enterprise over the open-source version of LanceDB.

### 1. Perfect for large deployments

LanceDB Enterprise powers global deployments with a secure, compliant distributed lakehouse system that
ensures complete data sovereignty and high performance at scale.

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Flexible Deployment** | Bring your own cloud, account, region, or Kubernetes cluster, or let LanceDB manage it for you. |
| **Multi-Cloud Support** | Available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. Open data layer that eliminates vendor lock-in. |
| **Data Security** | Encryption at rest, SOC 2 Type II, and HIPAA compliance. |

### 2. Best performance for petabyte scale

LanceDB OSS is built on the highly-efficient Lance format and offers extensive features out of the box. Our
Enterprise solution amplifies these benefits by means of a custom-build distributed system. 

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Performance** | Tens of thousands of QPS with latency in single-digit milliseconds, hundreds of thousands of rows per second write throughput, and low-latency indexing across many tables. |
| **Scalability** | Support workloads requiring data isolation with millions of active tables, or a single table with billions of rows. |

### 3. Developer experience

LanceDB Enterprise extends our OSS product with production-grade features while maintaining full
compatibility. Move from prototype to production by simply updating your connection string -- no code
changes or data migration required!

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Effortless Migration** | Migrate from Open Source LanceDB to LanceDB Enterprise by simply using a connection URL. |
| **Observability** | First-class integration with existing observability systems for logging, monitoring, and distributed traces using OpenTelemetry. |
