# Linear Combination Reranker

> **Note:** This reranker is deprecated. Use the `RRFReranker` if you need a score-based reranker.

The Linear Combination Reranker combines the results of semantic and full-text search using a linear combination of the scores. The weights for the linear combination can be specified, and defaults to 0.7, i.e, 70% weight for semantic search and 30% weight for full-text search.

> **Note:** Supported query type – Hybrid search only.
