# OpenAI Reranker (Experimental)

This reranker uses OpenAI chat model to rerank the search results. You can use this reranker by passing `OpenAI()` to the `rerank()` method. 
> **Note:** Supported query types – Hybrid, Vector, and FTS.

> **Warning:** This reranker is experimental. OpenAI does not have a dedicated reranking model, so it uses a chat model under the hood.
