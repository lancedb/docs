# Reciprocal Rank Fusion Reranker

This is the default reranker used by LanceDB hybrid search. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is an algorithm that evaluates the search scores by leveraging the positions/rank of the documents. The implementation follows this [paper](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf).


> **Note:** Supported query type – Hybrid search.

Accepted Arguments
----------------
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `K` | `int` | `60` | A constant used in the RRF formula (default is 60). Experiments indicate that k = 60 was near-optimal, but that the choice is not critical. |
| `return_score` | str | `"relevance"` | Options are "relevance" or "all". The type of score to return. If "relevance", will return only the `_relevance_score`. If "all", will return all scores from the vector and FTS search along with the relevance score. |


## Supported Scores for each query type
You can specify the type of scores you want the reranker to return. The following are the supported scores for each query type:

### Hybrid Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Hybrid Search score(`_relevance_score`). |
