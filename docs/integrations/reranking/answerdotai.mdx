# Answer.AI Rerankers

This integration uses [AnswersDotAI's rerankers](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/rerankers) to rerank the search results, providing a lightweight, low-dependency, unified API to use all common reranking and cross-encoder models.

> **Note:** Supported query types – Hybrid, Vector, and FTS.
