# VoyageAI Reranker

Voyage AI provides cutting-edge embedding and rerankers.

This reranker uses the [VoyageAI](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/) API to rerank the search results. You can use this reranker by passing `VoyageAIReranker()` to the `rerank()` method. Note that you'll either need to set the `VOYAGE_API_KEY` environment variable or pass the `api_key` argument to use this reranker.


> **Note:** Supported query types – Hybrid, Vector, and FTS.
