# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) reranker is used in LanceDB to rerank search results based on the MRR algorithm. This reranker is particularly useful when you want to prioritize documents that appear earlier in the search results.

> **Note:** Supported query type – Hybrid search.

Accepted Arguments
----------------
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `weight_vector` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for vector search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `weight_fts` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for FTS search results (0.0 to 1.0). |

### Hybrid Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Results only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Results have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Hybrid Search score(`_relevance_score`). |
