Because Lance is built on top of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/),
LanceDB fits naturally into Pandas-first workflows. You can ingest a `DataFrame`,
query it with LanceDB's vector operators, and keep working in Pandas without any glue code.

## Create a dataset

Start by importing LanceDB alongside your usual Pandas utilities and connect to a temporary database.

Use the familiar `pd.DataFrame` API to prepare your rows, then pass the entire frame to `db.create_table`.

## Vector search

Queries can return Pandas frames as well, so you can immediately inspect the results or pipe them into downstream analytics.

## Async API

For web services or background jobs that already rely on `asyncio`, use the asynchronous helpers to keep everything non-blocking.
