### genkitx-lancedb
Genkit is an open-source framework for building end-to-end AI and RAG pipelines with a clean, TypeScript-first
developer experience. The genkitx-lancedb plugin lets you use LanceDB as a high-performance vector store
inside your Genkit flows, so you can index, search, and retrieve data efficiently as part of your AI
applications.

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install genkitx-lancedb
```

### Usage

Adding LanceDB plugin to your genkit instance.

<CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
  {TsFrameworksGenkitUsage}
</CodeBlock>

You can run this app with the following command:
```bash
genkit start -- tsx --watch src/index.ts
```

This'll add LanceDB as a retriever and indexer to the genkit instance. You can see it in the GUI view

**Testing retrieval on a sample table**
Let's see the raw retrieval results

On running this query, you'll 5 results fetched from the lancedb table, where each result looks something like this:

## Creating a custom RAG flow

Now that we've seen how you can use LanceDB for in a genkit pipeline, let's refine the flow and create a RAG. A RAG flow will consist of an index and a retreiver with its outputs postprocessed an fed into an LLM for final response

### Creating custom indexer flows
You can also create custom indexer flows, utilizing more options and features provided by LanceDB.

In your console, you can see the logs

### Creating custom retriever flows
You can also create custom retriever flows, utilizing more options and features provided by LanceDB.
