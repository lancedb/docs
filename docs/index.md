[**LanceDB is an open-source vector database**](overview/index.md) designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of vectors and multimodal data. Use our documentation to build a production-grade service with a simple API for inserting, querying, and filtering vectors. 

LanceDB is ideal for **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **Generative AI applications**.

## **First-Time Users**
There are three ways to use LanceDB:

1. [**Embedded in your application:**](overview/quickstart.md) Integrate LanceDB directly into your backend—whether that’s a Django, Flask, FastAPI, or Node.js service—by installing the appropriate client library.
2. [**As a remote, serverless database:**](overview/quickstart-cloud.md) Create a LanceDB Cloud cluster that's completely serverless. Your application simply connects over HTTP/HTTPS, and LanceDB handles scaling, storage, and indexing for you. 
3. [**Use LanceDB Enterprise**](enterprise/index.md) to build the best private environment that suits your needs. Manage your own clusters via the Qdrant Cloud UI, but continue to run them within your own private infrastructure for complete security and sovereignty.
