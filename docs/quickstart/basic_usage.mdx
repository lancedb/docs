In this section, you'll learn basic operations in Python, TypeScript, and Rust SDKs.
The code examples are the same, regardless of whether you use LanceDB OSS or LanceDB Cloud/Enterprise.

For the LanceDB Cloud/Enterprise API Reference, check the [REST API Specification](/docs/api-reference).

## Installation options

Install LanceDB in your client SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon=Python
pip install lancedb  # or uv add lancedb
```

```bash TypeScript icon=js
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```bash Rust icon=Rust
cargo add lancedb
```
</CodeGroup>

### Preview Releases

Stable releases are created about every 2 weeks. For the latest features and bug fixes, you can install the preview release. These releases receive the same level of testing as stable releases but are not guaranteed to be available for more than 6 months after they are released. Once your application is stable, we recommend switching to stable releases.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon=Python
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/lancedb/ lancedb
```

```bash TypeScript icon=js
npm install @lancedb/lancedb@preview
```

```bash Rust icon=Rust
# Add the following to your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
lancedb = { git = "https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb.git", tag = "vX.Y.Z-beta.N" }
