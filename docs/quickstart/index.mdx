import { PyConnect, PyConnectCloud } from '/snippets/connection.mdx';

The quickest way to get going with LanceDB is with the open source version, which is file-based and
runs in-process (like SQLite). Let's get started using Python in just a few steps!

## 1. Install LanceDB

Install LanceDB in your client SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon=Python
pip install lancedb  # or uv add lancedb
```

```bash TypeScript icon=js
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```bash Rust icon=Rust
cargo add lancedb
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Connect to a LanceDB database

Using LanceDB's open source version is as simple as importing LanceDB as a library
and pointing to a local path -- no servers needed!

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyConnect}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >


### Optional: LanceDB Cloud or Enterprise versions

If you're looking for a fully-managed solution,
you can use LanceDB Cloud, which provides managed infrastructure,
security, and automatic backups. Simply replace the local path with a remote `uri`
that points to where your data is stored, and you're ready to go.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

For enormous scale and more advanced use cases beyond just search -- like
feature engineering, model training and more, check out [LanceDB Enterprise](/enterprise).

## 3. Create table and ingest data

LanceDB uses the notion of tables, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a field
and/or its metadata. The simplest way to begin is to define a list of objects, where each object
contains a vector field (list of floats) and optional fields for metadata.

Let's look at an example. We have the following records of characters in an adventure board game. The `vector` field is
a list of floats. In the real world, these would contain hundreds of floating-point values and be generated via an embedding model, but the example below shows a simple version with just 3 values.

The table schema is inferred from the data you provide, if not provided explicitly via
the `schema` parameter.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

The above code creates a table named `adventurers` and ingests four records into it, by overwriting
the table if it already exists. To raise a `ValueError` if the table already exists, you can
omit the `mode="overwrite"` parameter.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyQuickstartCreateTableNoOverwrite}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

LanceDB requires that you provide either data or a schema (via PyArrow) during table creation.
You can learn more on how to provide schemas explicitly in the "[working with tables](/docs/tables)" page.

## 4. Vector search

Now, let's perform a vector similarity search. The query vector should have the same dimensionality as
your data vectors. The search returns the most similar vectors based on Euclidean distance.

Our query is a vector that represents a `warrior`, which isn't in the data we ingested.
We'll find the result that's most similar to it!

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

It's often convenient to display the query results as a table. You can output the results of a vector search query
as a Pandas or Polars DataFrame. The example below shows the output as a Polars DataFrame.

It looks like the `knight` is the most similar adventurer to the `warrior` from our query!

| id | text   | vector            | _distance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | knight | [0.9, 0.4, 0.8] | 0.02 |
| 2 | ranger | [0.8, 0.4, 0.7] | 0.02 |

If you prefer Pandas, you can use the `to_pandas()` method to display the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

<CodeGroup>
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyQuickstartOutputPandas}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

## 5. Add data and run more queries

If you obtain more data, it's simple to add it to an existing table. In the same script or a new one, you
can connect to the LanceDB database, open an existing table.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyQuickstartOpenTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

You can then append more records to the existing table using the `add()` method.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyQuickstartAddData}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

To verify that our new data was added, we can run a different query that looks for adventurers similar to `wizard`.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyQuickstartVectorSearch2}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

| id | text   | vector            | _distance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | mage | [0.6, 0.3, 0.4] | 0.02 |
| 9 | priest | [0.6, 0.2, 0.6] | 0.03 |

The `mage` is the most magical of all our characters!

## 6. What's next?

You've learned how to create a LanceDB database, add data to it, and run vector search to find the most
similar results to your given query embedding. In the real world, embeddings capture meaning and vector
search allows you to find the most relevant data based on semantic similarity.

As you explore LanceDB further, you can combine vector search with other techniques like filtering based
on metadata fields, full-text search, hybrid search, and more.

Note that LanceDB is much more than "just a vector database" -- it's a multimodal lakehouse.
There's a lot more you can do with it! Learn more about what LanceDB is
