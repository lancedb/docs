Geneva automatically packages and deploys your Python execution environment to its worker nodes. This ensures that distributed execution occurs in the same environment and dependencies as your prototype.

We currently support one processing backend: **Ray**. There are 3 ways to connect to a Ray cluster: 

1. Local Ray
2. KubeRay: create a cluster on demand in your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Existing Ray Cluster

## Ray Clusters

### Local Ray

To execute jobs without an external Ray cluster, you can use `LocalRayContext`. This will auto-create a Ray cluster on your machine. Because it's on your laptop/desktop, this is only suitable for prototyping on small datasets. But it is the easiest way to get started. Simply define the UDF, add a column, call `Connection.local_ray_context()`, and trigger the job:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from geneva import udf
from geneva.db import Connection

@udf
def filename_len(filename: str) -> int:
    return len(filename)

tbl.add_columns({"filename_len": filename_len})

with Connection.local_ray_context():
    tbl.backfill("filename_len")
```
</CodeGroup>

Geneva will package up your local environment and send it to each worker process, so they'll have access to all the same dependencies as if you ran a simple Python script yourself.

### KubeRay

If you have a Kubernetes cluster with kuberay-operator, you can use Geneva to automatically provision RayClusters. To do so, define a Geneva cluster, representing the resource needs, Docker images, and other Ray configurations necessary to run your job. Make sure your cluster has adequate compute resources to provision the RayCluster. Here is an example Geneva cluster definition:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
import sys
import ray
import geneva
from geneva.cluster.builder import GenevaClusterBuilder
from geneva.cluster import K8sConfigMethod
from geneva.runners.ray.raycluster import get_ray_image

db = geneva.connect("s3://my-bucket/my-db")

ray_version = ray.__version__
python_version = f"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}"
cluster_name = "my-geneva-cluster" # lowercase, numbers, hyphens only
service_account = "my_k8s_service_account" # k8s service account that Geneva runs as
k8s_namespace = "geneva"  # k8s namespace

cluster = (
    GenevaClusterBuilder()
        .name(cluster_name)
        .namespace(k8s_namespace)
        .portforwarding(True) # required for kuberay to expose ray ports
        .aws_config(region="us-east-1") # only required if using AWS
        .config_method(K8sConfigMethod.LOCAL) # Load k8s config from `~/.kube.config`
        # (other options include EKS_AUTH to load from AWS EKS, or IN_CLUSTER to load the
        # config when running inside a pod in the cluster)
        .head_group(
            service_account=service_account,
            cpus=2,
            node_selector={"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-head":""}, # k8s label required for head in your cluster
        )
        .add_cpu_worker_group(
            cpus=4,
            memory="8Gi",
            service_account=service_account,
            node_selector={"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-worker-cpu":""}, # k8s label for cpu worker in your cluster
        )
        .add_gpu_worker_group(
            cpus=2,
            memory="8Gi",
            gpus=1,
            service_account=service_account,
            image=get_ray_image(ray_version, python_version, gpu=True), # Note the GPU image here
            node_selector={"geneva.lancedb.com/ray-worker-gpu":""}, # k8s label for gpu worker in your cluster
        )
        .build()
)

db.define_cluster(cluster_name, cluster)
# define_cluster stores the cluster metadata in persistent storage. The Cluster can then be referenced by name and provisioned when creating an execution context.

table = db.get_table("my_table")
with db.context(cluster=cluster_name):
    table.backfill("my_udf")
```
See [the API docs](https://lancedb.github.io/geneva/api/cluster/) for all the parameters GenevaClusterBuilder can use.

### External Ray cluster
If you already have a Ray cluster, Geneva can execute jobs against it too. You do so by defining a Geneva cluster which has the address of the cluster. Here's an example:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
import geneva
from geneva.cluster.builder import GenevaClusterBuilder
from geneva.cluster import GenevaClusterType

db = geneva.connect(my_db_uri)
cluster_name = "my-geneva-external-cluster"

cluster = (
    GenevaClusterBuilder()
    .name(cluster_name)
    .cluster_type(GenevaClusterType.EXTERNAL_RAY)
    .ray_address("ray://my_ip:my_port")
    .portforwarding(False) # This must be False when using an external Ray cluster
    .build()
)
db.define_cluster(cluster_name, cluster)

```
</CodeGroup>

## Dependencies and Manifests

Most UDFs require some dependencies: helper libraries like `pillow` for image processing, pre-trained models like `open-clip` to calculate embeddings, or even small config files. We have three ways to get them to workers:

1. Define dependencies explicitly in a manifest
2. Bake dependencies into an image
3. Auto-upload local dependencies

### Define dependencies explicitly in a manifest

We recommend defining dependencies explicitly: it's the easiest way to understand exactly what's running, and the least error-prone. To do so, define a Manifest, like so:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from geneva.manifest.builder import GenevaManifestBuilder

db = geneva.connect(my_db_uri)

manifest_name="dev-manifest"
manifest = (
    GenevaManifestBuilder()
        .name(manifest_name)
        .pip(["lancedb", "numpy"])
    ).build()

db.define_manifest(manifest_name, manifest)
```
</CodeGroup>

After workers start up, this will run `pip install lancedb numpy` on them. Geneva also supports defining `conda` dependencies, or sending a path to a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file, via the following methods on `GenevaManifestBuilder`:

```
.pip(deps) # list of pip dependencies, like "numpy" or "numpy==2.3.5"
.conda(deps) # list of conda dependencies, like "numpy" or "numpy=2.3.5"
.requirements_path(path) # path to local requirements.txt file, like "./requirements.txt"
.conda_environment_path(path) # path to local conda environment.yml file, like "./environment.yml"
# Note that file paths are relative to the execution directory.
```
Note that attempting to use both `pip` and `requirements_path` will raise an exception. Similarly, you can't use both `conda` and `conda_environment_path`.

### Bake dependencies into an image

Because the `pip` or `conda` methods involve installing packages, they will incur some startup costs. When your jobs are stable in production, therefore, it will be faster to build all your dependencies into the workers' images, then specify them like so:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from geneva.manifest.builder import GenevaManifestBuilder

db = geneva.connect(my_db_uri)

manifest_name = "prod-manifest"
manifest = (
    GenevaManifestBuilder()
        .name(manifest_name)
        .worker_image("myregistry.example.com/my-custom-worker-image:latest")
    ).build()

db.define_manifest(manifest_name, manifest)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
You can also define images in a GenevaCluster, e.g.:
```python Python icon="python"
cluster = (
    GenevaClusterBuilder()
        .name(cluster_name)
        .add_cpu_worker_group(
            WorkerGroupBuilder()
            .image("myregistry.example.com/my-custom-worker-image:latest")
        )
    .build()
)
```
However, if an image is defined in both a Cluster and a Manifest, the definition in the Manifest will take priority.
</Tip>

### Auto-upload local dependencies

Geneva can package your local environment and send it to Ray workers. This includes the current workspace root (if you're in a python repo) or the current working directory (if you're not). However, if you set `.upload_site_packages(True)`, your Python site-packages (defined by `site.getsitepackages()`) will be uploaded to workers as well. This is not recommended for production use, as it is prone to issues like architecture mismatches of built dependencies, but it can be a good way to iterate quickly during development.

To upload site packages:

```python Python icon="python"
from geneva.manifest.builder import GenevaManifestBuilder
db = geneva.connect(my_db_uri)
manifest_name = "dev-manifest"
manifest = (
    GenevaManifestBuilder()
        .name(manifest_name)
        .upload_site_packages(True)
    ).build()

db.define_manifest(manifest_name, manifest)
```

### What's in a manifest?
Here's a summary of what's in a manifest and how you can define it. (methods are all on `GenevaManifestBuilder`)

|Contents|How you can define it|
|---|---|
|Local working directory (or workspace root, if in a python repo)|Will be uploaded automatically.|
|Local python packages|Will be uploaded if you set `.upload_site_packages(True)`.|
|Python packages to be installed|Use `.pip(packages: list[str])` or `.conda(packages: dict[str, Any])`. See [Ray's RuntimeEnv docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/doc/ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv.html) for details.|
|Python dependency lists|Use `.requirements_path(path: str)` or `.conda_environment_path(path: str)`|
|Local python packages outside of `site_packages`|Use `.py_modules(modules: list[str])` or `.add_py_module(module: str)`. See [Ray's RuntimeEnv docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/api/doc/ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv.html) for details.|
|Container image for head node|Use `.head_image(head_image: str)` or `default_head_image()` to use the default. Note that, if the image is also defined in the GenevaCluster, the image set here in the Manifest will take priority.|
|Container image for worker nodes|Use `.worker_image(worker_image: str)` or `default_worker_image()` to use the default for the current platform. As with the head image, this takes priority over any images set in the Cluster.|

If you want to see exactly what is being uploaded to the cluster, set `.delete_local_zips(False)` and `.local_zip_output_dir(path)` then examine the zip files in `path`.

## Putting it all together: Execution Contexts

An execution context represents the concrete execution environment (Cluster and Manifest) used to execute a distributed job.

Calling `context` will enter a context manager that will provision an execution cluster and execute the Job using the Cluster and Manifest definitions provided. Because you've already defined the cluster and manifest, you can just reference them by name. Note that providing a manifest is optional. Once completed, the context manager will automatically de-provision the cluster.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
db = geneva.connect(my_db_uri)
tbl = db.get_table("my_table")

with db.context(cluster=cluster_name, manifest=manifest_name):
    tbl.backfill("embedding")
```
</CodeGroup>

In a notebook environment, you can manually enter and exit the context manager in multiple steps like so: 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
ctx = db.context(cluster=cluster_name, manifest=manifest_name)
ctx.__enter__()

# ... do stuff

ctx.__exit__(None,None,None)
```
</CodeGroup>
