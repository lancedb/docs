The Geneva Console provides a web-based interface for monitoring and managing Geneva jobs, clusters, and manifests.

## Why a Geneva Console?

- Collaboration: The console helps multiple people work together. Individual jobs can be run in a notebook or workflow, but to collaborate on jobs, it helps to be able to see everything that's running on a given database.
- History: See what has run in the past and diagnose any problems with your jobs.
- Shared resources: The console stores definitions of clusters and manifests, so you can easily tell what resources you want to use to run your job.

## Getting Started

The Geneva console is installed with the Geneva Helm chart; [contact LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/contact/) for access to the Helm chart).


1. Install or upgrade the Geneva Helm chart (see [Helm Deployment](/geneva/deployment/helm/)).
2. Find the pod that's running the console:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=geneva-console -n $NAMESPACE

NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
geneva-console-abc123-abcde   2/2     Running   0          4m58s
```
3. Forward port 3000 to access the console:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n $NAMESPACE geneva-console-abc123-abcde 3000:3000
```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. When prompted, enter your bucket and database, like:
```
s3://my-bucket/my-db
```

## What's in the Console?

### Jobs Overview
The heart of the console is an overview of all jobs that are running on a given database. See each job's status, progress, timing, and initiator.

### Job Details
Click on a job's ID to get more details, especially events that have happened in a job's life cycle, and metrics such as number of workers, rows, and fragments written.

### Clusters
See the Geneva clusters that you have defined to run jobs. Because clusters can be reused by name, this view can help you run a new job with the same resource constraints as a previous job.

### Manifests
See the Manifests you've defined and what packages/dependencies they contain. As with clusters, manifests are reusable, so it's easy to start a new job with the same dependencies as an old one by just specifying the manifest name.
