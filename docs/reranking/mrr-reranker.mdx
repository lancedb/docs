The **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** is a statistical measure used for evaluating the effectiveness of a search algorithm. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the order of the results is important, and you want to prioritize the highest-ranked relevant result.

## When to Use MRR vs RRF

- **MRR**: Use when you want to emphasize the importance of the top-ranked result. MRR is ideal for applications where the first correct answer is significantly more valuable than subsequent answers.
- **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)**: Use when you want to combine results from multiple sources and balance their contributions. RRF is more suitable when you need a balanced approach to merging results from different search techniques.

## Configuring Weights

The `MRRReranker` class allows you to configure weights for vector and full-text search (FTS) results. This flexibility enables you to adjust the influence of each search type in the final ranking.

- **weight_vector**: Weight for vector search results (range: 0.0 to 1.0).
- **weight_fts**: Weight for FTS search results (range: 0.0 to 1.0).

## Example Code

Below is an example of how to use the `MRRReranker` class in a hybrid search scenario:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from lancedb.rerankers import MRRReranker
import lancedb

# Connect to LanceDB
uri = "data/sample-lancedb"
db = lancedb.connect(uri)

# Create an instance of MRRReranker
reranker = MRRReranker(weight_vector=0.7, weight_fts=0.3)

# Perform hybrid search with MRR reranking
results = (
    db.search("example query", query_type="hybrid")
    .rerank(reranker)
    .limit(10)
    .to_pandas()
)

print("MRR Reranker results:")
print(results)
```
</CodeGroup>

By configuring the weights, you can tailor the reranking to prioritize either vector or FTS results based on your application's needs.
