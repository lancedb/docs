[LanceDB Enterprise](/enterprise) comes with an SQL endpoint that can be used for analytical queries and data exploration. The SQL endpoint is designed to be compatible with the
[Arrow FlightSQL protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html), which allows you to use any Arrow FlightSQL-compatible client to query your data.

## Installing the client

There are Flight SQL clients available for most languages and tools.  If you find that your
preferred language or tool is not listed here, please [reach out](mailto:contact@lancedb.com) to us and we can help you find a solution.  The following examples demonstrate how to install the Python and TypeScript
clients.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon="python"
# The `flightsql-dbapi` package provides a Python DB API 2 interface to the
# LanceDB SQL endpoint. You can use it to connect to the SQL endpoint and
# execute queries directly and get back results in pyarrow format.

pip install flightsql-dbapi
```

```bash TypeScript icon="square-js"
# LanceDB maintains a TypeScript client for the Arrow FlightSQL protocol.
# You can use it to connect to the SQL endpoint and execute queries directly.
# Results are returned in Arrow format or as plain JS/TS objects.

npm install --save @lancedb/flightsql-client
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

LanceDB uses the powerful DataFusion query engine to execute SQL queries.  This means that
you can use a wide variety of SQL syntax and functions to query your data.  For more detailed
information on the SQL syntax and functions supported by DataFusion, please refer to the
[DataFusion documentation](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/index.html).

### Setting Up the Client

Establish a connection to your LanceDB Enterprise SQL endpoint using your preferred FlightSQL client:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from flightsql import FlightSQLClient

client = FlightSQLClient(
    host="your-enterprise-endpoint",
    port=10025,
    insecure=True,
    token="DATABASE_TOKEN",
    metadata={"database": "your-project-slug"},
    features={"metadata-reflection": "true"},
)
```

```typescript TypeScript icon="square-js"
import { Client } from "@lancedb/flightsql-client";

const client = await Client.connect({
    host: "your-enterprise-endpoint:10025",
    username: "lancedb",
    password: "password",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Executing a Query

Run SQL queries against your LanceDB tables. Different clients may handle the FlightSQL protocol differently:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon="python"
def run_query(query: str):
    """Simple method to fully materialize query results"""
    info = client.execute(query)
    if len(info.endpoints) != 1:
        raise Error("Expected exactly one endpoint")
    ticket = info.endpoints[0].ticket
    reader = client.do_get(ticket)
    return reader.read_all()

result = run_query("SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = 'SFO'")
```

```typescript TypeScript icon="square-js"
const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin = 'SFO'");
```
</CodeGroup>

### Processing Results

Handle the query results returned by your FlightSQL client:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon="python"
print(result)
```

```typescript TypeScript icon="square-js"
// Results are returned as plain JS/TS objects and we create an interface
// here for our expected structure so we can have strong typing.  This is
// optional but recommended.
interface FlightRecord {
    origin: string;
    destination: string;
}

const flights = (await result.collectToObjects()) as FlightRecord[];
console.log(flights);
```
