**LanceDB** is an open-source [multimodal lakehouse](https://lancedb.com/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/)
designed to manage petabyte-scale data for AI/ML workloads. It's designed for both AI application
builders and researchers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Engineers">
    Use LanceDB as the retrieval + data layer for production AI: RAG, agents, semantic search,
    recommendation systems, and more.
    Keep multimodal data, metadata and embeddings in the same table and query them with vector search,
    full-text search (and SQL where it fits). Add new features (columns in your tables) at zero-cost
    as your application evolves.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Researchers">
  Use LanceDB to curate, explore and distribute large multimodal datasets for training and fine-tuning models.
  LanceDB comes with built-in table versioning, schema evolution, and fast random access, making it practical to do
  dataset slicing, exploratory analysis and shuffles on large, evolving corpora.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The LanceDB suite of products is built on top of the [Lance format](/lance), an open lakehouse
format for multimodal AI.

## Use cases

LanceDB is built for AI, and caters to broad variety of workloads:

- **Search**: Build high-performance search and retrieval applications using LanceDB's optimized storage, including vector search, full-text search, and hybrid search with secondary indexes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Supports feature extraction and data transformation, extending tables both vertically and horizontally with minimal I/O overhead.
- **Training**: Efficiently access and manage large-scale multimodal datasets for training and fine-tuning AI models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze and search through petabyte-scale multimodal datasets, including
video and point cloud data, to gain insights and inform model development.

## Choose how you run LanceDB

Depending on your needs, you can choose one of three ways to run LanceDB.

### LanceDB OSS
The fastest way to get started is the open-source embedded library, with client SDKs in Python, TypeScript
and Rust. Run it locally during development, then use the same data model and APIs as you scale up. Start here:

### LanceDB Enterprise

[LanceDB Enterprise](/enterprise) is for private deployments (private cloud or BYOC) and teams that want a
a broader “multimodal lakehouse” workflow on top of the same core table abstraction: search, exploratory data analysis,
feature engineering, and training-oriented data access—without building bespoke infrastructure to manage
petabyte-scale multimodal datasets. To get started, reach out at [contact@lancedb.com](mailto:contact@lancedb.com).

<Info>
**Built with scale, performance, and security in mind.**

LanceDB Enterprise is designed for very large-scale workloads in private deployments, with
high performance at extreme scale, or if you have strict security requirements.

### LanceDB Cloud

[LanceDB Cloud](/cloud) is a managed option for deploying LanceDB-backed vector search. Easily
create and manage projects in the Cloud UI, and integrate via REST API or client SDKs
(Python, TypeScript, Rust).
