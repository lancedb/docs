**LanceDB** is an open-source [multimodal lakehouse](https://lancedb.com/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/) for AI
designed to manage petabyte-scale data. It simultaneously caters to the needs of AI application engineers and AI researchers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Engineers">
    As a retrieval layer for large-scale Generative AI and search applications, such as RAG, chatbots, agents,
    e-commerce search & recommendation systems, and more. LanceDB is easy to set up, fast and highly
    scalable (while being cost-effective) for these use cases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Researchers">
    As a data management platform for researchers working on foundation model training, fine-tuning,
    feature engineering and explorative data analysis over petabyte-size datasets with multimodal data.
    Tasks that are painful with traditional data formats, such as metadata management, versioning, and
    data evolution, become simple and efficient with LanceDB.
  </Step>
</Steps>
