Now that you've completed the [LanceDB quickstart](/quickstart), you're ready to
explore some more table operations you'll typically need when working with LanceDB.

- **Ingest data into tables** from JSON data (and in Python, Pandas or Polars DataFrames)
- **Create empty tables** by defining explicit Arrow schemas
- **Vector similarity search** with filtering and projections
- **Filtered queries** that can operate on nested structs
- **Interoperate with DuckDB** and run traditional SQL queries on an Arrow table (Python)

<Note title="Python async users">
This page uses synchronous Python snippets for readability. If your app uses `asyncio`,
the same flow works with `connect_async(...)` and `await`-based table/query calls.
Use the example below as a template, and see [Quickstart](/quickstart#python-sync-and-async-apis)
for the general mapping.

## Dataset

We'll work with this small dataset based on characters from the legends of Camelot. Note that
the `vector` column holds 4-dimensional embeddings, and the `stats` column is a nested struct
with several integer fields, indicating each character's attributes.

```json camelot.json icon="brackets-curly" expandable=true
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "King Arthur",

    "description": "The purest and most virtuous knight, chosen to achieve the Holy Grail due to his unwavering spiritual purity.",
    "vector": [0.80, -0.20, 0.70, 0.78],
    "stats": { "strength": 4, "courage": 5, "magic": 2, "wisdom": 5 }
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Sir Percival",
    "role": "Knight of the Round Table",
    "description": "A loyal and innocent knight whose bravery and sincerity make him one of the key seekers of the Holy Grail.",
    "vector": [0.78, -0.36, 0.48, 0.52],

    "description": "Arthur's treacherous son or nephew who ultimately rebels against him, leading to Camelot's downfall.",
    "vector": [0.68, -0.30, -0.65, 0.20],
    "stats": { "strength": 4, "courage": 2, "magic": 1, "wisdom": 2 }
  }
]
```

<Note>
The `vector` arrays here are synthetic and for demonstration purposes only. In your real-world
applications, you'd generate these vectors from the raw text fields using a suitable embedding model.
</Note>

## Connect to a database

### Option 1: Local database

We start by connecting to a LanceDB database path. The example below uses a local path in LanceDB OSS.

<CodeGroup>
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyConnect}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnect}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsConnect}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### Option 2: Remote database

You can also connect LanceDB OSS directly to object storage. For credentials, endpoints, and provider-specific options, see
[Configuring storage](/storage/configuration).

If you're using a managed LanceDB service on either LanceDB Cloud or Enterprise, you can connect using a `db://` URI,
along with any encessary credentials. Simply replace the local path with a remote `uri`
that points to where your data is stored, and you're ready to go.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

To learn more about LanceDB Enterprise, see the [Enterprise documentation](/enterprise).

<Note>
- When you connect to a remote URI (Cloud/Enterprise), `open_table(...)` returns a *remote* table.
Remote tables support core operations (ingest, search, update, delete), but some convenience
methods for bulk data export are not available.
- In the Python SDK, `table.to_arrow()` and `table.to_pandas()` are not implemented for remote tables.
To retrieve data, use search queries instead: `table.search(query).limit(n).to_arrow()`.
</Note>

## Create a table and ingest data

### From JSON
LanceDB stores records in Lance tables. Each row is a record and each column
holds a field or related metadata. The simplest way to start is to obtain the source
data as a list of JSON records that includes a vector column and any metadata
fields you care about.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicImports}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicImports}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicImports}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

Load the data from the JSON file:
<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyDataLoad}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsDataLoad}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsDataLoad}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

You can now create a LanceDB table from the loaded data. Use the `mode="overwrite"` to
replace any existing table with the same name and overwrite its data (useful during
initial testing).

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

<Info>
If you want to avoid overwriting an existing table, omit the overwrite mode.
</Info>

### From Pandas DataFrames
<Badge color="green">Python Only</Badge>

You can create LanceDB tables directly from [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames. Simply
obtain the source data as a Pandas DataFrame, then create the table
and directly ingest to it.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicCreateTablePandas}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### From Polars DataFrames
<Badge color="green">Python Only</Badge>

You can also create LanceDB tables directly from [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) DataFrames. Simply
obtain the source data as a Polars DataFrame, then create the table
and directly ingest to it.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicCreateTablePolars}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

### From an Arrow schema

If you want to create an _empty_ table without any data -- say you want to
define the schema first and then incrementally add data later -- you can
do so by defining an Arrow schema explicitly.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicCreateEmptyTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicCreateEmptyTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicCreateEmptyTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

Once the empty table is defined, LanceDB is ready to accept new data via
the `add` method, as shown in the next section.

<Card title="Display table schema" icon="book">
LanceDB tables are type-aware, leveraging Apache Arrow under the hood.
You can display a given table's schema using the `schema` property or
method. For example, in Python, running `print(table.schema)` would show
something like the following:

```txt expandable=true
id: int64
name: string
role: string
description: string
vector: fixed_size_list<item: float>[4]
  child 0, item: float
stats: struct<courage: int64, magic: int64, strength: int64, wisdom: int64>
  child 0, courage: int64
  child 1, magic: int64
  child 2, strength: int64
  child 3, wisdom: int64
```
</Card>

## Append data to a table

LanceDB tables are mutable, and you can append new records to existing tables.
If you're starting with a fresh session, connect to the database and open the
existing table named `camelot`.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicOpenTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicOpenTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicOpenTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

Prepare the new records to add. Here, we add two new magical characters
via the `add` method.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicAddData}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicAddData}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicAddData}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

We now have two new records in the table. Let's begin to query our data!

## Vector search

It's straightforward to run vector similarity search in LanceDB. Let's answer
some questions about the data using vector search with projections (returning only
the desired columns).

> Q1: _Who are the characters similar to "wizard"?_

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicVectorSearchQ1}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicVectorSearchQ1}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicVectorSearchQ1}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

| name | role | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merlin | Wizard and Advisor | A powerful wizard and prophet |
| The Lady of the Lake | Mystical Guardian | A mysterious supernatural figu… |
| Morgan le Fay | Sorceress | A powerful enchantress, Arthur… |
| Queen Guinevere | Queen of Camelot | Arthur's queen, admired for he… |
| Sir Galahad | Knight of the Round Table | The purest and most virtuous k… |

We have Merlin, The Lady of the Lake, and Morgan le Fay in the top results, who
all have magical abilities.

Next, let's try to answer a different question that involves vector search while
filtering on a nested struct field. Filtering is done using the `where` method,
into which you can pass SQL-like expressions.

> Q2: _Who are the characters similar to "wizard" with high magic stats?_

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="Python">
    {PyBasicVectorSearchQ2}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicVectorSearchQ2}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicVectorSearchQ2}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

| name | role | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merlin | Wizard and Advisor | A powerful wizard and prophet |
| The Lady of the Lake | Mystical Guardian | A mysterious supernatural figu… |
| Morgan le Fay | Sorceress | A powerful enchantress, Arthur… |

Only three characters have magical abilities greater than 3. Merlin is
clearly the most magical of them all!

## Filtered search

You can also run traditional analytics-style search queries that do not
involve vectors. For example, let's find the strongest characters in
the dataset. In the query below, we leave the `search` method empty to indicate
that we don't want to use any vector for similarity search (in TypeScript/Rust,
use `query()` instead), and use the `where` method to filter on the `strength` field.

> Q3: _Who are the strongest characters?_

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicVectorSearchQ3}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicVectorSearchQ3}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicVectorSearchQ3}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

| name | role | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sir Galahad | Knight of the Round Table | The purest and most virtuous k… |
| Sir Gawain | Knight of the Round Table | A noble and honorable knight k… |
| Sir Percival | Knight of the Round Table | A loyal and innocent knight wh… |
| Sir Lancelot | Knight of the Round Table | Arthur's most skilled knight, … |
| Mordred | Traitor Knight | Arthur's treacherous son or ne… |

Clearly, the strongest characters are all Knights of the Round Table!

## SQL queries using DuckDB
<Badge color="green">Python Only</Badge>

You can leverage a full SQL engine like DuckDB to run more complex queries that involve
sorting, aggregations, joins, etc. To do this, you convert the LanceDB tables to an Arrow table,
which can be natively queried by DuckDB.

<Note>
This workflow applies to local (embedded) tables only. In the Python SDK, remote tables (Cloud/Enterprise)
do not support `to_arrow()` or `to_pandas()`. To retrieve data from remote tables, use search queries
with `.to_arrow()` on the results.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
# Convert table to an Arrow table
arrow_table = table.to_arrow()

import duckdb

# Query the Arrow table using SQL
duckdb_tbl = duckdb.sql("SELECT name, role, description FROM arrow_table WHERE stats.strength > 3 ORDER BY power DESC LIMIT 5")
print(duckdb_tbl)
```
</CodeGroup>

| name | role | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sir Galahad | Knight of the Round Table | The purest and most virtuous knight, chosen to… |
| Sir Lancelot | Knight of the Round Table | Arthur's most skilled knight, famed for unmatc… |
| Sir Gawain | Knight of the Round Table | A noble and honorable knight known for his cou… |
| Sir Percival | Knight of the Round Table | A loyal and innocent knight whose bravery and … |
| Mordred | Traitor Knight | Arthur's treacherous son or nephew who ultimat… |

<Info>
Under the hood, Lance tables are Arrow-based, leveraging Arrow's type system. This is why
it's trivial to query a Lance table using DuckDB, which also natively supports Arrow tables.
</Info>

## Add column

We can also add new columns to an existing LanceDB table using the `add_columns` method.
For this example, let's add a new float column named `power` that shows the average
of each character's strength, courage, magic, and wisdom stats.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicAddColumns}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicAddColumns}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicAddColumns}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

The example above sums up the individual stats and divides by 4 to compute the average.
The resulting average total stats is cast to an Arrow float type under the hood for the
Lance table.

We can display the results of this column in descending order of power.

> Q4: _Who are the most powerful characters?_

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicVectorSearchQ4}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicVectorSearchQ4}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicVectorSearchQ4}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

Note that LanceDB's `where` only filters rows, but doesn't sort them by applying an `ORDER BY`
clause that you may be used to when working with SQL databases. 

You can also sort the results after converting them to a Polars DataFrame.
In TypeScript/Rust, you can sort the
returned array in application code.

```python Python icon="python"
# Sort Polars DataFrame by power in descending order
print(r1.sort("power", descending=True).limit(5))
```

| name | role | description | power |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Merlin | Wizard and Advisor | A powerful wizard and prophet … | 4.0 |
| Sir Galahad | Knight of the Round Table | The purest and most virtuous k… | 4.0 |
| The Lady of the Lake | Mystical Guardian | A mysterious supernatural figu… | 3.75 |
| Sir Lancelot | Knight of the Round Table | Arthur's most skilled knight, … | 3.5 |
| Sir Gawain | Knight of the Round Table | A noble and honorable knight k… | 3.5 |

Merlin and Sir Galahad are the most powerful characters when considering the average of
all their abilities! Sir Lancelot and the Lady of the Lake follow closely behind.

## Delete data

You can delete rows from a LanceDB table using the `delete` method with
a filtering expression.

Say we want to remove Mordred, the traitor knight, from our table.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicDeleteRows}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicDeleteRows}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicDeleteRows}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

This will delete the row(s) where the `role` value matches "Traitor Knight".
You can verify that the row has been deleted by running a search query again,
and confirming that Mordred no longer appears in the results.

## Drop column

If you want to remove or delete a column from an existing LanceDB table, you can use
the `drop_columns` method.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicDropColumns}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicDropColumns}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicDropColumns}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

This will remove the `power` column we added earlier from the table schema.

## Drop table

If you want to delete an entire table from the database, you can use the
`drop_table` method.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python">
    {PyBasicDropTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsBasicDropTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsBasicDropTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

This will delete the `camelot` table from the connected LanceDB database.

<Info>
See the full code for these examples (including helper functions) in the
`basic_usage` file for the appropriate client language in the
[docs repo](https://github.com/lancedb/docs/tree/main/tests).
</Info>

## What about vector indexes?

LanceDB supports vector indexes to speed up similarity search on large datasets.
For datasets up to a few hundred thousand vectors, LanceDB's highly efficient kNN
(brute-force) retrieval of nearest neighbors is often sufficient. As your dataset
grows larger, you can create vector indexes on your vector columns to accelerate
search. See the [indexing](/indexing/) documentation for details on how to create and use
vector indexes in LanceDB.
