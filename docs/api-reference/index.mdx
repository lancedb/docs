For detailed information of the available functions and methods in your preferred language's SDKs,
refer to the API documentation linked below.

If you're looking for a REST API reference, visit the [REST API](/api-reference/rest) page.

If you're looking for conceptual and practical namespace guidance before diving into method signatures, see
[Namespaces and Catalog Model](/namespaces) and [Using Namespaces in SDKs](/tables/namespaces).

## Supported SDKs

## Community-driven SDKs

In addition to the officially supported SDKs, the LanceDB community may contribute SDKs in other languages.
These SDKs may not have the same level of support or feature parity as the official ones supported by LanceDB, but they can be an option
for users working in languages other than those listed above.
