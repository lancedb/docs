The easiest way to get started with LanceDB is the open source version, which is an embedded database that
runs in-process (like SQLite). Let's get started in just a few steps!

## 1. Install LanceDB

Install LanceDB in your client SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon=Python
pip install lancedb  # or uv add lancedb
```

```bash TypeScript icon=js
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```bash Rust icon=Rust
cargo add lancedb
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Connect to a LanceDB database

Using LanceDB's open source version is as simple as importing LanceDB as a library
and pointing to a local path -- no servers needed!

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyConnect}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnect}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >


### Optional: LanceDB Cloud or Enterprise versions

If you're looking for a fully-managed solution,
you can use LanceDB Cloud, which provides managed infrastructure,
security, and automatic backups. Simply replace the local path with a remote `uri`
that points to where your data is stored, and you're ready to go.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

For enormous scale and more advanced use cases beyond just search -- like
feature engineering, model training and more, check out [LanceDB Enterprise](/enterprise).

## 3. Create and query a table

Create a small table and ingest four records. The schema is inferred unless you
pass one explicitly.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

Now run a first vector similarity search. The query vector should match your
stored vector dimensionality.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

Collect the results as arrays or data frames.

<Info>
In Python, if you prefer working with Pandas, you can use the `to_pandas()` method to display the results
as a Pandas DataFrame.

## What's next?

You've learned how to install LanceDB, connect, create a table, and run a first
vector search. In the real world, embeddings capture meaning and vector search
allows you to find the most relevant data based on semantic similarity.

Note that LanceDB is much more than "just a vector database" -- it's
[a multimodal lakehouse](https://lancedb.com/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/).
There's a lot more you can do with it! Continue
to the [Table management](/tables) guide to build on
this example with schema options, appending data, updates, and versioning.

As you explore LanceDB further, you can combine vector search with other techniques like filtering based
on metadata fields, full-text search, hybrid search, and more. Check out the tutorials
and guides below to continue learning.
