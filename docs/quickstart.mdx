The easiest way to get started with LanceDB is the open source version, which is an embedded database that
runs in-process (like SQLite). Let's get started in just a few steps!

## 1. Install LanceDB

Install LanceDB in your client SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python icon=Python
pip install lancedb  # or uv add lancedb
```

```bash TypeScript icon=js
npm install @lancedb/lancedb
```

```bash Rust icon=Rust
cargo add lancedb
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Connect to a LanceDB database

Using LanceDB's open source version is as simple as importing LanceDB as a library
and pointing to a local path -- no servers needed!

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyConnect}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnect}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    { "// Rust imports go here\n" }
    {RsConnect}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >


### Optional: LanceDB Cloud or Enterprise versions

If you're looking for a fully-managed solution,
you can use LanceDB Cloud, which provides managed infrastructure,
security, and automatic backups. Simply replace the local path with a remote `uri`
that points to where your data is stored, and you're ready to go.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsConnectCloud}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

For enormous scale and more advanced use cases beyond just search -- like
feature engineering, model training and more, check out [LanceDB Enterprise](/enterprise).

## 3. Obtain data and ingest into LanceDB

Let's look at an example. We have the following records of characters in an adventure board game.
The vector field is a list of floats. In the real world, these would contain hundreds of
floating-point values and be generated via an embedding model, but the example below shows
a simple version with just 3 values.

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsQuickstartDefineStruct}
    {RsQuickstartCreateTable}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

Note that LanceDB requires at least one of the schema and the data to create a table.
If you do not mention a schema parameter, it's inferred from the data.

## 4. Run a vector similarity search

Now, let's perform a vector similarity search. The query vector should have the same
dimensionality as your data vectors. The search returns the most similar vectors based
on Euclidean distance.

Our query is a vector that represents a warrior, which isn't in the data we ingested.
We'll find the result that's most similar to it!

<CodeGroup >
    <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
    {PyQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="TypeScript" language="TypeScript" icon="square-js">
    {TsQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>

    <CodeBlock filename="Rust" language="Rust" icon="rust">
    {RsQuickstartVectorSearch1}
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup >

<Accordion title="If you prefer working with Pandas, you can also get results as a Pandas DataFrame">
  Use the `to_pandas()` method to convert query results into a Pandas DataFrame.
  <CodeBlock filename="Python" language="Python" icon="python">
  {PyQuickstartOutputPandas}
  </CodeBlock>
</Accordion>

Depending on your language, you can collect query results as a list/array of objects or DataFrames
to be used downstream in your application.

## What's next?

You've learned how to install LanceDB, connect, create a table, and run a first
vector search. In the real world, embeddings capture meaning and vector search
allows you to find the most relevant data based on semantic similarity.

Note that LanceDB is much more than "just a vector database" -- it's
[a multimodal lakehouse](https://lancedb.com/blog/multimodal-lakehouse/).
There's a lot more you can do with it! Continue
to the [Table management](/tables) guide to build on
this example with schema options, appending data, updates, and versioning.

As you explore LanceDB further, you can combine vector search with other techniques like filtering based
on metadata fields, full-text search, hybrid search, and more. Check out the tutorials
and guides below to continue learning.
