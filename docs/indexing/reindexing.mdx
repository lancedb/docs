## Reindexing and Incremental Indexing

Reindexing is the process of updating the index to account for new data, keeping good performance for queries. This applies to either a full-text search (FTS) index or a vector index. For ANN search, new data will always be included in query results, but queries on tables with unindexed data will fallback to slower search methods for the new parts of the table. This is another important operation to run periodically as your data grows, as it also improves performance. This is especially important if you're appending large amounts of data to an existing dataset.

<Tip>
When adding new data to a dataset that has an existing index (either FTS or vector), LanceDB doesn't immediately update the index until a reindex operation is complete.
</Tip>

> Both LanceDB OSS and Cloud support reindexing, but the process (at least for now) is different for each, depending on the type of index.

When a reindex job is triggered in the background, the entire data is reindexed, but in the interim as new queries come in, LanceDB will combine results from the existing index with exhaustive kNN search on the new data. This is done to ensure that you're still searching on all your data, but it does come at a performance cost. The more data that you add without reindexing, the impact on latency (due to exhaustive search) can be noticeable.

## Incremental Indexing in LanceDB Cloud

**LanceDB Cloud & Enterprise** support incremental reindexing through an automated background process. When new data is added to a table, the system automatically triggers a new index build. As the dataset grows, indexes are continuously updated in the background.

> While indexes are being rebuilt, queries use brute force methods on unindexed rows, which may temporarily increase latency. To avoid this, set `fast_search=True` to search only indexed data.

<Note title="Checking Index Status">
Use `index_stats()` to view the number of unindexed rows. This will be zero when indexes are fully up-to-date.
</Note>

## Incremental Indexing in LanceDB OSS

**LanceDB OSS** supports incremental indexing, which means you can add new records to the table without reindexing the entire table.

<Note title="Performance Considerations">
New data added after creating the FTS index will appear in search results while the incremental index is still in progress, but with increased latency due to a flat search on the unindexed portion. LanceDB Cloud & Enterprise automate this merging process, minimizing the impact on search speed.
</Note>

## FTS Index Reindexing

FTS Reindexing is **supported in LanceDB OSS, Cloud & Enterprise**. However, it requires manual rebuilding when a significant amount of new data needs to be reindexed.
